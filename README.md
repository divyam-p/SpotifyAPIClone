# Description 
>> This is a Java REST API project using microservices (MongoDB and Neo4J) that communicate with each other to accomplish specific use-cases. 
* The MongoDB database is used to keep track of the Songs that different profiles (people) can like or dislike. 
* The Neo4J database is used to keep track of profiles which can like or dislike songs as well as follow or unfollow friends to figure out what songs their friends currently like. 
* NOTE : Specifications to the different API calls can be found in the code itself in the ProfileDriverImpl.java, PlaylistDriverImpl.java, and SongDalImpl.java.
